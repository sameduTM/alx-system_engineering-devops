### Postmortem: Unexpected Web Stack Outage Due to Database Overload

#### Issue Summary

- **Duration**: The outage began on March 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM GMT and ended at 2:00 PM GMT, lasting for a total of 4 hours.
- **Impact**: During this period, our main e-commerce platform was intermittently unavailable, leading to a complete service disruption for approximately 60% of our users. Affected services included the checkout process and user account access, resulting in lost sales and user frustration.
- **Root Cause**: The primary cause was identified as an unexpected surge in database queries due to a recent feature deployment, which overloaded our primary database server.

#### Timeline

- **10:15 AM**: Issue detection occurred through monitoring alerts indicating high database response times.
- **10:20 AM**: Initial investigation by the on-duty engineer suggested a spike in user traffic as a potential cause.
- **10:45 AM**: Further analysis ruled out traffic spikes; attention shifted to recent changes in the platform.
- **11:00 AM**: Customer complaints via support channels began to escalate the urgency of the resolution.
- **11:30 AM**: Misleading investigation into a suspected DDoS attack temporarily redirected resources.
- **12:00 PM**: Incident escalated to the senior engineering team after ruling out DDoS.
- **12:30 PM**: Identification of a problematic feature deployment causing excessive database queries.
- **1:00 PM**: Rollback of the recent feature deployment initiated.
- **1:30 PM**: Database performance began to stabilize post-rollback.
- **2:00 PM**: Full service restoration confirmed, monitoring continued to ensure stability.

#### Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause was traced back to a newly introduced feature that inadvertently increased the load on the database with inefficient queries. This feature, although tested, had not been evaluated under production-level loads, leading to an unexpected surge in database queries. The resolution involved rolling back the feature deployment to stabilize the database load. Subsequent analysis confirmed the rollback effectively reduced the strain on the database, restoring normal operation.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future, we have identified several corrective actions:

- **Performance Testing**: Enhance our testing framework to simulate real-world loads more accurately, particularly for database-intensive operations.
- **Query Optimization**: Review and optimize all recent changes to database queries to ensure efficiency.
- **Monitoring Improvements**: Implement more granular monitoring of database performance metrics to detect anomalies earlier.
- **Incident Response Training**: Improve training for on-duty engineers to better identify and escalate unusual patterns that could indicate underlying issues.

Specific tasks to address these measures include:

- Develop and deploy a new set of performance tests by April 10, 2024.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of all database queries introduced in the last 30 days and optimize as necessary by April 15, 2024.
- Add additional database performance monitoring tools and set up alerts for unusual patterns by April 20, 2024.
- Schedule an incident response workshop for the engineering team by April 25, 2024.

By addressing these areas, we aim to enhance our platform's resilience against unforeseen loads and improve our response time to future incidents, ensuring a more reliable service for our users.
